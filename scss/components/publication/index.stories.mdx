# Publication

This component is intended to wrap rich text content from a CMS. It will attempt to apply sensible default styles for bare HTML elements within. This is useful if you'd like to have more control over the styling of ad-hoc HTML.

This is not intended as a drop-in solution for styling content when you are directly in control of the markup. You _could_ use it like that, but it would be better to use the correct components instead.

    <h3>How about this h3?</h3>
    <p>
      From 1971 to 1972, David Byrne was a member of a duo named Bizadi with
      Marc Kehoe. He performed various offbeat acts and developed an interest in
      performing. He attended the Rhode Island School of Design in the 1970–1971
      term, and the Maryland Institute College of Art in the 1971–1972 term.

    <p>Do you even like Talking Heads? I hope so.</p>
    <h4>WOW it's a h4!</h4>
    <p>
      Have you ever wondered how Talking Heads got their name? Here's what
      bassist Tina Weymouth had to say about <strong>that very topic</strong>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      A friend had found the name in the TV Guide, which explained the term used
      by TV studios to describe a head-and-shoulder shot of a person talking as
      'all content, no action'. It fit.
    </blockquote>
    <cite>Tina Weymouth on the telly in like 1992.</cite>
    <p>You know what we should probably write some code.</p>
    <h5>Here's a h5 before we do that.</h5>
    <p>Don't worry this bit won't be about Talking Heads.</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        const lyrics = () => [ `Watch out, you might get what you're after`,
        `Cool babies, strange but not a stranger`, `I'm an ordinary guy`,
        `Burning down the house`, `Hold tight`, `Wait 'til the party's over`,
        `Hold tight`, `We're in for nasty weather`, `There has got to be a way`,
        `Burning down the house`, ] lyrics.map((line) => console.log(line))
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Ha. I lied to you. That <em>was</em> about Talking Heads after all.
    </p>
    <h2>You are a fool to have trusted me.</h2>
    <p>
      Hey, the heading size was supposed to be a h6, but I used a h2 instead.
      It's a bit like when David Byrne returns to the stage in his iconic "big
      suit" for the closing numbers of the Stop Making Sense show. If you
      haven't see Stop Making Sense, you really should watch it:
