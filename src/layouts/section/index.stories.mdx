# Section

The Section should be used to separate vertical sections of content. You would most commonly use this with the HTML `section` element, but a `div` or other semantically appropriate element will work too.

It has padding-bottom, and that's it. Good use of Sections will ensure that a page has consistency in its rhythm as the user scrolls down.

You should not add any additional `class`es or styles to a Section.

<Story name="Vanilla">
  <section
    class="sl-section"
    style={{ backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1)' }}
  >
    <div
      style={{
        backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1)',
        padding: '0.5rem 2rem',
      }}
    >
      <p>This is a Section</p>
      <p>
        There's a dummy `div` in here with a background color that allows you to
        see where the section actually is. You're welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see the padding at the bottom here. Don't copy the background
        color style when using this markup, <em>obvs</em>.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>
</Story>
