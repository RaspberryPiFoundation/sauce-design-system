# Container

The Container should be used as the immediate and only child of a `Section`, or on its own.

It has padding on the X axis, centers itself in the viewport, and has a `max-width` of 1300px. Other than that it has no opinion on its contents.

You should not add any additional `class`es or styles to a Container.

<Story name="Vanilla">
  <div className="sl-container">
    <div
      style={{
        backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1)',
        padding: '0.5rem 2rem',
      }}
    >
      <p>This is a container</p>
      <p>
        There's a dummy `div` in here with a background color that allows you to
        see where the container actually is. You're welcome.
