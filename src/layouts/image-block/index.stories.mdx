# Image Block?

An image block has some content and an image. The important thing here is the image, which must meet a certain set of requirements.

The image's aspect ratio must be `2:1`. The image must also have a "quiet area" on either side of the horizontal axis. Propotionally this is a ratio of `3:10:3`.

For example, an image with a size of 1,600 pixels would would have 300 pixels quiet area, 1,000 pixels for the image's focus area, and another 300 pixels quiet area.

The purpose of the quiet area is to allow the image to adapt to different screen sizes, without losing the focus of the image.

Quiet areas can contain graphical elements (or nothing at all).

In the following examples you can see the quiet area on the images illustrated with a transparent red box.
