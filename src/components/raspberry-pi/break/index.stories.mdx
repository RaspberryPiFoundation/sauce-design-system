# Break

Creates a thematic break in a piece of content. Not much else to say. Here's what it looks like:

<Story name="Vanilla">
  <hr className="sc-rp-break" />
</Story>

That's about it. Make sure you're using the `hr` element correctly. For guidance, here's how it's defined in the [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-hr-element).

<blockquote>
  The `hr` element represents a paragraph-level thematic break, e.g. a scene
  change in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a
  reference book.
</blockquote>

It is **not** intended to be used as a page break, or to denote sections of a page. It's very rare that we would need this. It's possible that you want a purely decorative line-break, without any semantics attached. It's possible to achieve this look with an element that contains no semantic meaning by switching the `hr` for a `div`, as seen in this example.

<Story name="Non-Semantic">
  <div className="sc-rp-break"></div>
</Story>

Here's a subtle on, for when you need it. Same rules about semantics apply.

<Story name="Subtle">
  <div className="sc-rp-break sc-rp-break--subtle"></div>
</Story>
