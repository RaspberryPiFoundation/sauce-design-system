# Design Principles

There are three:

## Keep it simple

We have a lot to show off and value to offer, but let’s try not to overwhelm. Doing one thing at a time in a calm manner is better than trying to do a lot of things at the same time. This will allow our value propositions to be crystal clear and will let personality shine through.

## This is for anyone

Our offerings are free or affordable, accessible, inclusive, international. Anything we do should be easily available to anyone who wants to join in. Our digital products should reflect this sense of inclusivity and they should aim to break down whatever barriers are in the way of participation.

## It’s alive

That moment of delight & empowerment when a new piece of code works, or when an engineering idea comes together is a wonderful thing. We are facilitating these moments around the world and our digital products should reflect this. Using the other two principles as a foundation, let’s surface our personality.
