# Creating a new Component

1. Design
2. Build in app
3. Identify and discuss candidates for inclusion in pattern library
4. Port to pattern library - build barebones version first (very little vars, mixins etc)
5. Identify and discuss any tokens that can be extracted from the components
6. Update with vars and mixins etc
