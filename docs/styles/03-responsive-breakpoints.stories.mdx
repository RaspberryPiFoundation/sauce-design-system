# Responsive Breakpoints

There are no definitive breakpoints.

The web is much more fluid that "viewport width".

Components and layouts should be responsible for their own responsiveness.

Allow the design to tell you when a new breakpoint is required.

Literally watch for the POINT at which it BREAKS.

To apply a styles for any abirtrary media query, use can use the `device` module:

```scss
@use 'src/mixins/device';

.some-selector {
  width: 100%;

  @include device.mq('min-width', 550px) {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
```

For `min-width` specifically there's a convenient helper mixin:

```scss
@use 'src/mixins/device';

.some-selector {
  width: 100%;

  @include device.min-width(550px) {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
```

That said, the following breakpoints are available, but please consider them a guide, rather than a set of instructions. Again, your component or layout should be dictating where the styles need to change.

Name                | min-width
--------------------|----------
`$phone-portrait`   | 0px
`$phone-landscape`  | 600px
`$tablet-portrait`  | 800px
`$tablet-landscape` | 1000px
`$laptop`           | 1200px

Use like this:

```scss
@use 'src/mixins/device';

.some-selector {
  width: 100%;

  @include device.respond-to('tablet-portrait') {
    width: 50%;
  }

  @include device.respond-to('laptop') {
    width: 25%;
  }
}
```
