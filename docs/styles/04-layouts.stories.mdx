# Layouts

A layout is just that - "layout". It contains no overly-opinionated design. It's a collection of rules around alignment and spacing.

There will likely be very few layouts. We tend to encounter the same layout patterns over-and-over, so it's like that everything we're going to reuse has already been defined somewhere else in our estate.

If you find a layout that has not been defined in Sauce, and we're sure that we're going to reuse it, then we should define it.

## Grid System

There is no grid system. This may come as a shock.

There is no grid system because complicated ad-hoc layouts are easier than ever with Flexbox and Grid. You may have to write some CSS. This is in fact A Good Thingâ„¢.

Using a traditional, responsive, 12-columns grid system pollutes the global CSS scope with dozens and dozens of CSS selectors that we most likely won't use.

Shipping less CSS to the user's browser is the biggest benefit, at the expense of some developer convenience.

That developer convenience, however, can also lead to poorly written HTML. By mandating that layout happens in CSS rather than HTML, we further [separate our concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) between the document content and its appearance.

## What do we use instead of a Grid System

If it's a Layout that Sauce provides, we should use that. If the design contains and unique arrangement of elements then you should attempt to recreate it with CSS.

During this process you should work closely with the author of the design (if possible), or just _a_ designer if the original designer is unavailable.

While building an interface, allow your layouts, components, and content to tell you when a new breakpoint is required. They should be literally the **point** at which the layout **breaks**.

Collaboration between designers and developers always leads to better implementation of designs. It's like pair programming, except one of you is making sure that the design survives the transition to code.

We can be more confident that the designs we ship are closer to the intended design, and we can be better assured that we've taken different devices into account. Not only that, but we're shipping fewer bytes to the user.
