# Media Queries

When the term "Responsive Design" was [coined by Ethan Marcotte in 2010](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/), we had little idea of where this exciting new technique would take us.

Fast-forward ten years. With the number of devices available to us, from watches up to smart TVs and everything inbetween, it's gotten almost impossible to confidently set three or four breakpoints for your entire application and trust that they'll always deliver the best experience.

What's more, the web is much more fluid that "viewport width". We can—and _should_—employ a greater range of media queries to ensure that our experiences offer the best experience we can to any user, on any device.

Using a greater mix of all the [media queries available to us in modern web browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries), we can better cater for a user's accessibility needs, device preferences, ambient lighting, pointer resolution, and more. We can even detect if JavaScript is available, **in CSS**.

It's simply no longer the case that "responsive" means "change the layout as the viewport resizes".

**Responsive should mean "this design respects the user, their device settings, and their browsing context."**

To apply styles for any media query, use can use the `device` module:

```scss
@use 'scss/mixins/device';

.some-selector {
  width: 100%;

  @include device.mq('min-width', 550px) {
    width: 50%;
  }

  @include device.mq('prefers-reduced-motion', 'reduce') {
    transition-duration: 0;
  }

  @include device.mq('hover', 'none') {
    outline: blue;
  }
}
```

For `min-width` specifically there's a convenient mixin. We'll probably end up with more mixins for media-queries we use regularly.

```scss
@use 'scss/mixins/device';

.some-selector {
  width: 100%;

  @include device.min-width(550px) {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
```

Users that prefer reduced motion can be catered for with this mixin:

```scss
@use 'scss/mixins/device';

.some-selector {
  transition-duration: 250ms;

  @include device.reduced-motion {
    transition-duration: 0;
  }
}
```

Users with displays with a high pixel density can be targetted with this mixin. An example use here would be swapping an image for a higher resolution equivalent.

```scss
@use 'scss/mixins/device';

.some-selector {
  background-image: url('./some-image.jpg');

  @include device.high-dpi {
    background-image: url('./some-image@2x.jpg');
  }
}
```

FUN FACT: One day we may be able to detect a user's connection speed with another media query, and use a combination to determine if a user has both the screen pixel density _and_ the connection bandwidth to handle downloading a higher-resolution image.

## Last Resort

That said, the following breakpoints are available, but please consider them a guide, rather than a set of instructions. Again, your component or layout should be dictating where the styles need to change.

Be very careful using these, as they may be removed in a future release. At present your Scss output will contain a warning when you use one of these.

| Name                | min-width |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| `$phone-portrait`   | 0px       |
| `$phone-landscape`  | 600px     |
| `$tablet-portrait`  | 800px     |
| `$tablet-landscape` | 1000px    |
| `$laptop`           | 1200px    |

Use like this:

```scss
@use 'scss/mixins/device';

.some-selector {
  width: 100%;

  @include device.respond-to('tablet-portrait') {
    width: 50%;
  }

  @include device.respond-to('laptop') {
    width: 25%;
  }
}
```
